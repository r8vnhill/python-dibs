"""
author.py â€” Demonstrates encapsulation and immutability using private fields and read-only
properties.

This module defines a simple `Author` class that encapsulates an author's name and a list of works.
The works are exposed through a read-only property as an immutable tuple to prevent accidental
modification.

## Usage

Run this script directly to see how the `Author` class behaves with read-only access to its works.

```bash
uv run ./path/to/author.py
```

    This class encapsulates an author's name and their list of works.
    The list of works is exposed as a read-only property to ensure immutability from the outside.
