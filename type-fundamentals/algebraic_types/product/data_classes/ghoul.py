"""
ghoul.py â€“ Demonstrates the use of immutable dataclasses and safe object mutation using `replace`.

This module defines an immutable `Ghoul` class using Python's `@dataclass(frozen=True)` decorator.
It also shows how to simulate changes (such as reducing hunger) by creating a new instance
instead of mutating the original, preserving immutability.

## Usage

Run the script directly to simulate a ghoul consuming food and reducing its hunger.

```bash
uv run ./path/to/ghoul.py
```

class Ghoul:
    """
    Represents a ghoul with a name and hunger level.

    This dataclass is marked as frozen, meaning instances are immutable after creation.
    Use `dataclasses.replace` to create a modified copy with updated values.
