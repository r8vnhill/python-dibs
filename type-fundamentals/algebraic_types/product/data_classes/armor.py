"""
armor.py - Demonstrates the difference between regular Python classes and data classes.

This script defines two armor types:
- `_Armor`: A manually implemented class with private fields.
- `Armor`: A data class with automatic support for structural equality and readable representation.

The goal is to illustrate key differences between:
- Identity (`is`) and structural equality (`==`)
- Manual class definitions vs. using the `@dataclass` decorator

## Usage

Run this script directly to see comparison results in the console.

```bash
uv run ./path/to/armor.py
```

class _Armor:  # Preceding underscore just to distinguish it from the `Armor` data class
    """
    A manually implemented class representing an armored suit.

    This class uses private attributes and does not override comparison or representation methods.
    As a result, equality checks compare object identity (i.e., memory address) rather than field
    values.

    Intended for contrast with the `Armor` data class.

        This constructor stores the model name and power level of the armor, both as private fields.

@dataclass
class Armor:
    """
    A lightweight data structure representing an armor model.

    This class is implemented as a dataclass, which provides automatic support for comparison and
    readable representations.
    Unlike manually defined classes, `dataclass` instances are compared based on their field values.

    ## Usage:
    You can create and compare instances of `Armor` easily:

    >>> a1 = Armor("Mark II", 100)
    >>> a2 = Armor("Mark II", 100)
    >>> print(a1 == a2)  # True

    The string representation is also user-friendly:

    >>> print(a1)  # Armor(model='Mark II', power=100)

    :ivar model: The name or version of the armor (e.g., "Mark II").
    :type model: str
    :ivar power: The armor's power level.
