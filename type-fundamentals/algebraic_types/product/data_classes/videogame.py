videogame.py â€“ Demonstrates use of Python dataclasses and `astuple`.

This module defines a simple data class to represent a video game and shows how to convert an
instance into a tuple using `dataclasses.astuple`.

## Usage

Run this file directly to see a sample tuple unpacking of a video game instance.

```bash
uv run ./path/to/videogame.py
```
"""

from dataclasses import dataclass, astuple


@dataclass
class VideoGame:
    """
    Represents a video game with basic metadata.

    This class uses the `@dataclass` decorator to automatically generate useful methods such as
    `__init__`, `__repr__`, and `__eq__`.

    :ivar title: The title of the video game.
    :ivar developer: The company or studio that developed the game.
