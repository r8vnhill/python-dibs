connection.py â€” Demonstrates the use of an enum with pattern matching in Python.

This module defines a ConnectionState enum to represent the status of a connection and a function
`handle_connection` that uses structural pattern matching to return an appropriate message for each
state. It includes a fallback case to handle invalid inputs.

Primarily intended for educational purposes to illustrate how enums and match-case statements can be
used together in Python.

## Usage

Run this script directly to see how different connection states are handled.
```bash
uv run ./path/to/connection.py
```
