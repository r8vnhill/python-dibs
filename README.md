This repository contains the companion code for the course **"Diseño e Implementación de Bibliotecas de Software" (DIBS)**.

The course is taught in **Spanish**, but this repository is written in **English** to make it accessible to a broader audience and to align with common programming conventions and documentation standards.

## 🔍 About

The code in this repository is designed to support the lessons from DIBS, focusing on practical and idiomatic usage of language features such as:

- Loops and control flow
- Comprehensions (lists, sets, dictionaries)
- Collection transformations and filtering
- Optional values and configuration logic

All examples are intended for **educational purposes**, helping learners understand core concepts before applying them in larger systems or libraries.
